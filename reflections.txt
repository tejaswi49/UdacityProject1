You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:
  * What new skills have you learned?
  * What has been easy?
  * What has been difficult?
  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

Your response goes here!

* Came across different tags like <sup>, <hr>, <s>

* Working on basic tags like <p>,<a> and some others has been easy.

* I am still skeptical about my tag indentations. Also I was wondering if there is any tag that could give the text bold and italic format instead of using 2 different tags(<em>,<strong>).
Still working on that….

* Most of the time I faced difficulty in remembering syntax of various tags. I usually do the Cmmd+F thing in MDN reference document when I had any problem, but now due to practice   I don’t need to do that often
